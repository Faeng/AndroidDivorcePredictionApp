    <string name="movie_n1" translatable="false">Titanic (1997)</string>
    <string name="movie_1">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020Titanic has all the makings of a boilerplate love story: Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is from the wrong side of the tracks, Rose (Kate Winslet) comes from high society, and they meet by chance and fall in love. But set against the spectacle of the sinking of the historic ship — and with greatest-love-song-of-all-time contender "My Heart Will Go On" in the background — like Jack, this movie moves beyond its seemingly plain origins.</string>
    <string name="movie_n2" translatable="false">Before Sunrise (1995)</string>
    <string name="movie_2">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020Director Richard Linklater pulls of a remarkable feat with this casual film: the entire relationship unfolds as the two main characters walk around a European city, just chatting. It proves that great romances don\'t have to be so emotionally wrought. The film spawned two sequels, Before Sunset and Before Midnight, which follow the same couple.</string>
    <string name="movie_n3" translatable="false">Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)</string>
    <string name="movie_3">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020This film-festival favorite, which was nominated for a slew of awards at the end of 2019, follows a woman who is commissioned to travel to a remote island to paint a portrait of a woman as part of an arranged marriage; of course, she falls in love with her subject, and a forbidden romance ensues.</string>
    <string name="movie_n4" translatable="false">A Star Is Born (2018)</string>
    <string name="movie_4">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020If you\'re looking for a story about people brought together by talent and torn apart by fame, you can watch a number of takes on A Star Is Born: There\'s the 1937 original with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and the 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. But only the most recent one, with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, has a performance of the heart-rending song "Shallow."</string>
    <string name="movie_n5" translatable="false">If Beale Street Could Talk (2018)</string>
    <string name="movie_5">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020"From Barry Jenkins — director of Moonlight, which is its own sort of romance — comes this James Baldwin adaptation. It's about a couple, madly in love and expecting a child, whose relationship is upended when one of them is accused of a crime he didn't commit.</string>
    <string name="movie_n6" translatable="false">Shape of Water (2017)</string>
    <string name="movie_6">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020If you know anything about Guillermo del Toro, then you know better than to ever try to predict what the fantastical director’s take on a love story would be. Besides, of course, that it will be more beautiful and unique than you could ever imagine. Shape of Water tells the tale of Elisa, a mute woman who works as a cleaning lady at a government laboratory, as she finds herself falling in love with the lab’s top-secret specimen: an amphibious creature. This film is a true testament that love comes in all shapes and sizes.</string>
    <string name="movie_n7" translatable="false">The Big Sick (2017)</string>
    <string name="movie_7">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon’s real-life hospital romance turned movie is one of the most original and thoughtful romances in years. In the face of tragedy, an estranged couple grows closer somehow by one of them being in a coma. Also, Holly Hunter is the best mom.</string>
    <string name="movie_n8" translatable="false">Silver Linings Playbook (2012)</string>
    <string name="movie_8">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020The first real entry of the Cooper/Lawrence film trio, Silver Linings Playbook is the story of what happens when perfectly flawed people find love together. The film also won Lawrence her first Oscar, and that’s pretty outstanding for a picture loosely categorized as a romantic comedy.</string>
    <string name="movie_n9" translatable="false">The Notebook (2004)</string>
    <string name="movie_9">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020Read me this story, and I’ll find you. Damn. Nicholas Sparks is cheesy and oftentimes over the top, but The Notebook is a romantic story of love that just beautiful enough that it transcends all of the cheesiness it takes to tell it.</string>
    <string name="movie_n10" translatable="false">Call Me By Your Name (2017)</string>
    <string name="movie_10">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020That peach scene is something else. The Luca Guadagnino-directed film perfectly encapsulates the feelings of first love and love lost in a beautiful Italian setting. Bonus points: CMBYN is the rare gay love story where someone doesn’t get beaten or end up with HIV.</string>

    <string name="tenthing_item1">1. Stay calm and gather information</string>

    <string name="tenthing_item10">10. Ask if your needs are being met</string>
    <string name="tenthing_des_item1">No matter how upset you are at first hearing the news, it\'s important that you collect as much information about what happened between your partner and this other person. </string>
    <string name="tenthing_des_item2">It\'s not healthy for you to sit around in this situation, and could prevent you from processing everything in a healthy way.</string>
    <string name="tenthing_des_item6">If your partner\'s been sexual with another individual, you can\'t be confident that he or she used protection, and you certainly don\'t know what kind of diseases or infections the person they were sexually active with may possess,\" Michael warned.</string>
    <string name="tenthing_des_item10">Before you can say yes to continuing to pursue the relationship, you need to think things over. \"Give yourself space to not forgive, and if you get to a place when you feel like you can forgive, that\'s fine,\" Michael said. \"But, if not, that\'s really OK, too. There\'s no rule that says you have to come to a place of forgiveness.\" In other words, don\'t stay in the relationship if you find yourself in frequent pain.</string>

    <string name="eightstep_des_item1">You are both entitled to your own feelings, and it\'s crucial to accept his or her position without trying to change it.</string>
    <string name="eightstep_des_item3">Your goal is to be the mature, kind, and loving person your partner fell in love with, not the anxious, angry person in survival mode.</string>
    <string name="eightstep_des_item4">You must be calm. You must give your partner space. And you must act in a way that will allow him or her to miss you (translation: no yelling, no begging, no drama).</string>
    <string name="eightstep_des_item5">You may think this divorce is largely your partner\'s fault and have a list of things you\'d like him or her to change—but the only thing you can control is yourself. In the end, you\'ll both need to change in order to be happy, so it\'s time for you to get to work on your end of the deal. So go back to yoga class, see a therapist on your own, visit old friends, or learn a new hobby.</string>
    <string name="eightstep_des_item6">Once you do meet again, focus on positive, happy interactions instead of getting to work on the relationship right away. Over time, once some of the pressure is removed and you\'re able to laugh and smile together again, you can assess whether you\'re both still interested in working things out.</string>
    <string name="eightstep_des_item8">If you want a common theme of divorce, it\'s the inability to solve the problem [in a way] that both people feel satisfied with,says Sussman.</string>

    <string name="flowermeaning6">\u0020\u0020\u0020\u0020Forget-Me-Nots are an ideal option to gift to a loved one. These plants imply true love, and just as the name implies, they are given in the hope they (or the sender) will never be forgotten.
